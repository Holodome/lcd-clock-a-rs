Firmware for [LCD-Nixie-Clock](https://www.waveshare.com/lcd-clock-a.htm).

This is a retro-styled clock with 6 TFT LCD's, several buttons and ambient LED's.

## Why?

Because at the time I bought this clock a had a spare Raspberry Pi Pico but the official 
product [wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/LCD-Clock-A) lacked firmware for it.

## Goals 

This project aims to be as simple and readable as possible while providing 
desired functionality. It is not (heavily) optimized
